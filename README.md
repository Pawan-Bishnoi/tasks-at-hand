# tasks-at-hand
Electron app to make task listing easy. 


I need it to list "todays tasks" in the morning.
Aim is to keep it simple and keyboard only because mouse makes you slow.


# How to run
You need nodejs and electron installed (preferrably globally).
In the project's root directory just run "electron ."
